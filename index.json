I primarily use large genomic datasets (based on already published studies) to re-analyse them in a novel comparative genomic framework and discover global patterns of molecular evolution. During my PhD (ANR HotRec) I used meta-analytic approaches and advanced statistics to describe and quantify the diversity and determinants of evolutionary processes (e.g. recombination, GC-biased gene conversion) among a large set of species.\nThough I am still a young researcher (PhD defended in late 2022), I was rapidly involved in a wide range of thematics spanning molecular evolution, population genomics and evolutionary biology at a broad sense. My first post-doc is actually about testing an original theory of evolution of gene expression (the runaway process proposed by Thomas Lenormand, ANR CisTransEvol), while I am at the same time involved in the newly arising field of pangenomic and structural variation within genomes (ERC funded, supervised by Claire Mérot). Among these very different topics I find it very interesting to study evolution at many levels of organisation, including genes, genomes, populations and species. I am interested in integrative approaches reconciling different levels of organisation under a more general and synthetic model (e.g. how patterns at the scale of genes could influence global genome evolution, how both are co-evolving).\nAlternatively, I am also involved in the development of bio-informatic pipelines as well as modern statistical methods for population genomics, especially Artificial Intelligence. As Deep Learning is getting more and more applications, I believe it is a powerful versatile approach for population genomics. Deep Learning, especially Neural Networks, has proven to be “unreasonably effective” for inferences and predictions on large scale genomic data and almost any problem can be adressed successfuly with Neural Networks.\nDownload my resume ","date":1700302260,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1700302260,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am an evolutionary biologist broadly interested in genome evolution and patterns of genetic diversity.

In plants it is generally thought that gene regulatory sequences, especially promoters and 5'-3'’ untranslated regions, are enriched in hotspots, but this has been characterized in a handful of species only. We also lack a clear description of fine-scale variation in recombination rates within genic regions and little is known about hotspot position and intensity in plants. To address this question we constructed fine-scale recombination maps from genetic polymorphism data and inferred recombination hotspots in eleven plant species. We detected gradients of recombination both in 5' and 3' of genic regions in most species, yet gradients varied in intensity and shape depending on specific hotspot locations and gene structure. To further characterize recombination gradients, we decomposed them according to gene structure by rank and number of exons. We generalised the previously observed pattern that recombination hotspots are organised around the boundaries of coding sequences. However our results suggest that variations among species were driven more by hotspot location among and within genes than by differences in size or intensity among species. Our results shed light on the variation in recombination rates at a very fine scale, beyond genes averages across the whole genome, revealing the diversity and complexity of genic recombination gradients emerging from the interaction between hotspot location and gene structure.","tags":null,"title":"Ubiquitous recombination gradients within plant genic regions shaped by recombination hotspots","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My new paper about meiotic recombination in plants is now published in PLOS Genetics.\nMeiotic recombination is a universal feature of sexually reproducing species. During meiosis, crossovers play a fundamental role for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis and reshuffles alleles among chromosomes. How much variation in recombination is expected within a genome and among different species remains a central question for understanding the evolution of recombination. We characterized and compared recombination landscapes in a large set of plant species with a wide range of genome size. We found that the number of crossovers varied little among species, from one mandatory to no more than five or six crossovers per chromosomes, whatever the genome size. However, we identified two main patterns of variation along chromosomes (with a few exceptions) that can be explained by a new conceptual model where chromosome length, chromosome structure and gene density play a role. The strong association between gene density and recombination was already known, but raised new questions not only about the evolution of recombination rates but also on their distribution along chromosomes.\n","date":1668258846,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668258846,"objectID":"e9289e728e4fec5e857713a681d3603c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/diversity-and-determinants-of-recombination-landscapes-in-flowering-plants/","publishdate":"2022-11-12T13:14:06.043Z","relpermalink":"/post/diversity-and-determinants-of-recombination-landscapes-in-flowering-plants/","section":"post","summary":"My new paper about meiotic recombination in plants is now published in PLOS Genetics.\nMeiotic recombination is a universal feature of sexually reproducing species.

To date, the broad diversity of recombination landscapes among plants has rarely been investigated and a formal comparative genomic approach is still needed to characterize and assess the determinants of recombination landscapes among species and chromosomes. We gathered genetic maps and genomes for 57 flowering plant species, corresponding to 665 chromosomes, for which we estimated large-scale recombination landscapes. We found that the number of crossover per chromosome spans a limited range (between one to five/six) whatever the genome size, and that there is no single relationship across species between genetic map length and chromosome size. Instead, we found a general relationship between the relative size of chromosomes and recombination rate, while the absolute length constrains the basal recombination rate for each species. At the chromosome level, we identified two main patterns (with a few exceptions) and we proposed a conceptual model explaining the broad-scale distribution of crossovers where both telomeres and centromeres play a role. These patterns correspond globally to the underlying gene distribution, which affects how efficiently genes are shuffled at meiosis. These results raised new questions not only on the evolution of recombination rates but also on their distribution along chromosomes.","tags":null,"title":"Diversity and determinants of recombination landscapes in flowering plants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Brazier","Emira Cherif","Jean-François Martin","André Gilles","Simon Blanchet","Yahui Zhao","Marine Combe","R.J.
